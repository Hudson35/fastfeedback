/* Absolute Imports and Aliases
    -If you're working on a large project, some of your 'import' statements
    might suffer form the '../../../' spaghetti
    -In such cases, instead of relative imports, we might want
    to use absolute imports. Assuming that the 'components' directory exists at teh root,
    we might want 'import' statements to look like:
    
        import Button from 'components/button'
